            Release notes for [JP21] SC LIVE 4
================================================================================

Version 1.0.0.36: 3/30/2022
	+ Increase drive strength of I2S data lines to potentially fix AIRDJ-29350
	+ ETA5805 firmware version 1.1
	+ TAS5805M firmware version 1.7 - JP21-78

Version 1.0.0.35: 3/18/2022
	+ Improve ESD performance by forcing LCD reset on I2C bus errors

Version 1.0.0.34: 3/11/2022
	+ TAS5805M firmware version 1.5
	
Version 1.0.0.33: 3/4/2022
	+ Fixed bug JP21-70: Mic/Aux doesn't work after leaving computer mode
	+ Fixed initial state reported of the rear Mic2/Aux switch
	+ Add watchdog to refresh the platter LCDs every 500ms

Version 1.0.0.32: 2/21/2022
	+ Add support for ETA5805 amp chip and auto detect which one is installed.
	+ ETA5805 firmware version 1.0
	+ TAS5805M firmware version 1.4
	+ Update product name

Version 1.0.0.31: 1/26/2022
	+ Changed meters to use bitwise OR'd values, JP21-56

Version 1.0.0.29: 10/27/2021
	+ Updated with Terry's latest DSP amp code, version 1.3, fixing PR hitting
	  the grill.

Version 1.0.0.28: 10/21/2021
	+ Updated with Terry's latest DSP amp code, version 1.2, optimized for 44.1k

Version 1.0.0.27: 9/21/2021
	+ Further refinements to controlling the audio clocks. Now all I2S signals to 
	  the AZ05 are tri-stated when the nAUDIO_RESET pin is asserted from the AZ05. 
	  This works around a hardware error where the audio clocks can back drive the 
	  AZ05 preventing the unit from fully powering down. This is also how the HG04 
	  works around this hardware issue.
	+ Change I2S sync method to use Tx instead of Rx. This is also the same as the HG04.
	+ Increase code optimization level.

Version 1.0.0.26: 9/3/2021
	+ Fixed audio input issue due to I2S clocks getting turned on/off upon playback 
	  or record in Linux. All audio clocks just stay on now.
	+ Changed default serial number to a string of binary zeros (per Yuriy’s request)

Version 1.0.0.24: 8/25/2021
	+ Fixed crossfader reversed, JP21-23
	+ Enabled support for reception of MIDI running status. However transmission 
	  of MIDI running status is not supported by the Linux build/driver, so it is 
	  not enabled for sending MIDI to Linux. This is likely the cause of issue 
	  JP21-26 and likely many other “issues".
	+ Add support for Serato DJ challenge/response

Version 1.0.0.23: 6/25/2021
	+ Updated with Terry's latest DSP amp code, version 1.0
	+ Removed hack for OTS1 hardware error of AUX inputs to support the new OTS2
	  hardware. Note: The AUX inputs will no longer work on OTS1 hardware with this 
	  and all newer versions of firmware.

Version 1.0.0.22: 6/22/2021
	+ Fixed Split Cue On/Off MIDI message is reverse, JP21-8
	+ Fixed FX Channel Assign knob is sending incorrect message for "M" position,
	  JP21-9
	+ Fixed Platters are only sending Double Precision Absolute Controller messages, 
	  not the messages for 3rd party, JP21-10
	+ Fixed Channel 3 High EQ knob not sending 0x40 in center detent when turned 
	  from 0x00, JP21-12
	+ Fixed Cue Mix knob is not sending 0x40 when in the center detent, JP21-13
	+ Fixed Entire Time Section Off message is not turning off the "-" and first 
	  digit, JP21-14
	+ Fixed Sysex for BPM uses wrong values for decks (byte 5), JP21-15
	+ Fixed Cannot get BPM to display correctly on wheel displays, JP21-16
	+ Add support for AZ05 firmware update mode on bootup by holding BCK+FWD+ENC
	  
Version 1.0.0.17: 5/5/2021
	+ Initial release
